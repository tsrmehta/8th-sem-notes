> ***Foundation of big data***
> 
> >In this digital world, everyone leaves a trace. From our travel habits to our workouts and entertainment, the increasing number of internet connected devices that we interact with on a daily basis record vast amounts of data about us there's even a name for it Big Data. Ernst and Young offers the following definition: big data refers to the dynamic, large, and disparate volumes of data being created by people, tools, and machines. It requires new, innovative and scalable technology to collect, host, and analytically process the vast amount of data gathered in order to drive real-time business insights that relate to consumers, risk, profit, performance, productivity management, and enhanced shareholder value. There is no one definition of big data but there are certain elements that are common across the different definitions, such as velocity, volume, variety, veracity, and value. These are the V's of big data Velocity is the speed at which data accumulates. Data is being generated extremely fast in a process that never stops. Near or real-time streaming, local, and cloud-based technologies can process information very quickly. Volume is the scale of the data or the increase in the amount of data stored. Drivers of volume are the increase in data sources, higher resolution sensors, and scalable infrastructure. Variety is the diversity of the data. Structured data fits neatly into rows and columns in relational databases, while unstructured data is not organized in a predefined way like tweets, blog posts, pictures, numbers, and video. Variety also reflects that data comes from different sources; machines, people, and processes, both internal and external to organizations. Drivers are mobile technologies social media, wearable technologies, geo technologies video, and many, many more. Veracity is the quality and origin of data and its conformity to facts and accuracy. Attributes include consistency, completeness, integrity, and ambiguity. Drivers include cost and the need for traceability. With the large amount of data available, the debate rages on about the accuracy of data in the digital age. Is the information real or is it false? Value is our ability and need to turn data into value. Value isn't just profit. It may have medical or social benefits, as well as customer, employee or personal satisfaction. The main reason that people invest time to understand big data is to derive value from it. Let's look at some examples of the V's in action. Velocity. Every 60 seconds, hours of footage are uploaded to YouTube, which is generating data. Think about how quickly data accumulates over hours, days, and years. Volume. The world population is approximately 7 billion people and the vast majority are now using digital devices. Mobile phones, desktop and laptop computers, wearable devices, and so on. These devices all generate, capture, and store data approximately 2.5 quintillion bytes every day. That's the equivalent of 10 million blu-ray DVDs. Variety. Let's think about the different types of data. Text, pictures, film, sound, health data from wearable devices, and many different types of data from devices connected to the internet of things. Veracity. Eighty percent of data is considered to be unstructured and we must devise ways to produce reliable and accurate insights. The data must be categorized, analyzed, and visualized. Data scientists, today, derive insights from big data and cope with the challenges that these massive data sets present. The scale of the data being collected means that it's not feasible to use conventional data analysis tools, however, alternative tools that leverage distributed computing power can overcome this problem. Tools such as Apache Spark, Hadoop, and its ecosystem provides ways to extract, load, analyze, and process the data across distributed compute resources, providing new insights and knowledge. This gives organizations more ways to connect with their customers and enrich the services they offer. So next time you strap on your smartwatch, unlock your smartphone, or track your workout, remember your data is starting a journey that might take it all the way around the world, through big data analysis and back to you.

[Data Model and Dat Modeling](https://sciencelogic.com/glossary/data-modeling)  

[Data modeling type](https://www.simplilearn.com/what-is-data-modeling-article)  

> ***Data Model Structure***
> 
>  The data model structure refers to the way data is organized, represented, and related within a database or information system. It defines the entities (objects), attributes (properties), relationships, and constraints that govern the data's structure and behavior. The data model structure provides a blueprint for how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated. Here are some key components of a data model structure:
> 
> 1. Entities: Entities represent real-world objects or concepts that are of interest to the organization. Each entity has a set of attributes that describe its properties. For example, in a customer relationship management system, entities may include "Customer," "Product," and "Order."
> 
> 2. Attributes: Attributes are the characteristics or properties of entities. They define the specific data elements associated with an entity. Attributes can be descriptive, such as name, age, or address, or they can be quantitative, such as quantity or price.
> 
> 3. Relationships: Relationships define the associations and dependencies between entities. They represent how entities are connected to each other. Relationships can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many, indicating the cardinality and participation constraints between entities. For example, a customer can have multiple orders, representing a one-to-many relationship.
> 
> 4. Keys: Keys uniquely identify individual instances of entities within a data model. They ensure the uniqueness and integrity of the data. Common types of keys include primary keys, which uniquely identify each entity instance, and foreign keys, which establish relationships between entities.
> 
> 5. Constraints: Constraints define rules and conditions that govern the data model's behavior and ensure data integrity. Examples of constraints include uniqueness constraints, which enforce the uniqueness of values in certain attributes, and referential integrity constraints, which maintain the integrity of relationships between entities.
> 
> 6. Hierarchies: Hierarchies define the organizational structure or levels of entities within the data model. They represent parent-child relationships, allowing for data aggregation and drill-down capabilities. Hierarchies are commonly used in dimensional models for data warehousing and business intelligence.
> 
> 7. Data Types: Data types specify the nature and format of attribute values. They define the allowed range of values, the size of the data, and the operations that can be performed on the data. Common data types include text, numbers, dates, booleans, and more.
> 
> 8. Cardinality: Cardinality refers to the number of instances or occurrences of one entity that are related to another entity in a relationship. It specifies whether the relationship is one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.
> 
> 9. Data Flow: Data flow diagrams illustrate the flow of data within a system or process. They show how data is input, transformed, and output by various components and entities.
>  
>  Data model structures can vary depending on the specific data modeling approach, such as relational, hierarchical, network, or object-oriented models. Each model has its own way of structuring and organizing data. The chosen data model structure should align with the requirements, complexity, and nature of the data and the intended use of the system or database.

> ***Operation***
> 
> In big data analysis, data modeling refers to the process of designing and creating a structure or representation of the data that facilitates analysis, processing, and retrieval of insights. Data modeling plays a crucial role in organizing and understanding the data, enabling efficient data operations. Here are some key data model operations in big data analysis:
>
>  1. Conceptual Data Modeling: Conceptual data modeling involves identifying and defining the high-level concepts, entities, and relationships in the data. This operation focuses on understanding the business requirements, data semantics, and the overall structure of the data.
>  
>  2. Logical Data Modeling: Logical data modeling is the process of translating the conceptual data model into a more detailed and technology-agnostic representation. It defines the entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints in a format that can be implemented using various data storage technologies.
>  
>  3. Physical Data Modeling: Physical data modeling involves implementing the logical data model using specific data storage technologies. It includes defining the data schema, tables, columns, data types, indexes, and other physical storage optimizations. The physical data model is specific to the chosen database or storage system.
>
>  4. Schema Design: Schema design refers to the process of designing the structure and organization of the database or storage system. It involves making decisions about data partitioning, indexing strategies, denormalization, and other optimizations to optimize data retrieval and processing performance.
>
>  5. Data Mapping: Data mapping involves establishing the relationships and mappings between different data sources and the data model. It addresses issues related to data integration and alignment across various data systems, ensuring consistency and accuracy of data across the analysis process.
>
>  6. Data Transformation: Data transformation operations involve converting data from its original format to a format that is compatible with the data model. This includes tasks like data cleansing, data aggregation, data enrichment, and data normalization. Transformation operations prepare the data for analysis and ensure its quality and consistency.
>
>  7. Metadata Management: Metadata management is an important aspect of data modeling in big data analysis. It involves capturing and managing metadata, which provides information about the data, such as data source details, data lineage, data definitions, and data transformations. Metadata management enables effective data discovery, cataloging, and understanding of the data.
>
>  8. Data Cataloging: Data cataloging involves creating a catalog or inventory of available data assets, including their descriptions, relationships, and metadata. A data catalog helps in discovering relevant data for analysis, understanding data dependencies, and promoting data reuse across the organization.
>
>  9. Data Virtualization: Data virtualization enables accessing and querying data from multiple sources without physically moving or replicating the data. It provides a virtual representation of the data, abstracting the underlying data sources and simplifying data access and integration.
>
>  10. Model Iteration and Optimization: Data models in big data analysis are often refined and optimized based on evolving business requirements, data insights, and performance considerations. Model iteration involves revisiting and updating the data model as new data sources, analytics needs, or scalability requirements arise.
>
>  Effective data modeling in big data analysis lays the foundation for efficient data operations, analysis, and decision-making. It helps organizations structure their data, define relationships, and optimize storage and retrieval, enabling accurate and insightful analysis of large and complex datasets.

> ***Constrains***
> 
>   Data model constraints are rules that are enforced on the data in a data model. They can be used to ensure that the data is accurate, consistent, and complete. Data model constraints are an important part of big data analysis because they can help to improve the quality of the data and to make the analysis more reliable.
>
>  While the specific constraints can vary based on the data model and the requirements of the analysis, here are some common constraints used in big data analysis:
>
>  1.  Entity Integrity Constraint: This constraint ensures that each entity instance in a table or collection has a unique identifier or primary key. It prevents duplicate or missing entity instances, ensuring the integrity and uniqueness of data.
> 
>  2.  Referential Integrity Constraint: Referential integrity ensures that relationships between entities are maintained correctly. It enforces that foreign key values in one table or collection match primary key values in another table or collection. It prevents orphaned or invalid references between entities.
> 
>  3.  Unique Constraint: The unique constraint ensures that specific attributes or combinations of attributes have unique values within a table or collection. It prevents duplicate entries and enforces data uniqueness.
>
>  4.  Data Type Constraint: Data type constraints define the allowed data types for attributes. They ensure that values stored in the attribute match the specified data type, such as numbers, strings, dates, or booleans.
>
>  5.  Range Constraint: Range constraints define the permissible range of values for a specific attribute. They ensure that attribute values fall within the specified range, such as a numeric range or a date range.
> 
>  6.  Nullability Constraint: Nullability constraints define whether an attribute can accept null or missing values. They enforce whether an attribute must have a value (not null) or can be left empty (nullable).
> 
>  7.  Cardinality Constraint: Cardinality constraints define the allowable number of instances or occurrences of one entity that can be associated with another entity in a relationship. They specify whether the relationship is one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.
> 
>  8.  Business Rule Constraint: Business rule constraints capture specific business requirements or rules that must be adhered to in the data model. These rules can be custom constraints defined based on the unique characteristics of the data and the analysis requirements.
>
> Data model constraints can be enforced by the database management system (DBMS). When a user tries to insert or update data that violates a constraint, the DBMS will generate an error message. This helps to prevent users from entering invalid data into the database.
>
> Data model constraints are an important part of big data analysis. They can help to improve the quality of the data and to make the analysis more reliable. By enforcing data model constraints, you can help to ensure that your data is accurate, consistent, and complete. This will make it easier to find the data that you need, to perform analysis on the data, and to make informed decisions.

This can make it easier to find the data that you need, to perform analysis on the data, and to make informed decisions.



> ***Data Model Types***
> 
> There are several types of data models used in the field of data management. Each type represents a different way of organizing and representing data. Here are some common types of data models:
> 
> 1. Relational Data Model: The relational data model is the most widely used type of data model. It organizes data into tables with rows and columns, where each table represents an entity, and each row represents an instance of that entity. Relationships between tables are established through keys. The relational model uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for data manipulation and querying.
> 
> 2. Hierarchical Data Model: The hierarchical data model organizes data in a tree-like structure, where each record has a parent-child relationship. Data is represented as a series of nested records, with a single root record at the top. This model is often used in mainframe database systems and is suitable for representing one-to-many relationships.
> 
> 3. Network Data Model: The network data model is similar to the hierarchical model but allows for more complex relationships. In this model, data is organized using a graph-like structure, where records can have multiple parent and child records. It uses pointers to establish relationships between records.
> 
> 4. Object-Oriented Data Model: The object-oriented data model represents data as objects, similar to the concepts in object-oriented programming. Data objects encapsulate both data and behavior in the form of methods or functions. This model allows for inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. It is often used in object-oriented programming languages and object-oriented databases.
> 
> 5. Entity-Relationship (ER) Model: The entity-relationship model is a conceptual model used to represent the relationships between entities in a database. It uses entities, attributes, and relationships to depict the structure of the data. The ER model is often used as a foundation for designing relational databases.
> 
> 6. Dimensional Data Model: The dimensional data model is used in data warehousing and business intelligence applications. It organizes data into dimensions and measures. Dimensions represent the descriptive attributes of data, while measures represent the numerical values being analyzed. The dimensional model is optimized for fast and efficient query processing and analysis.
> 
> 7. NoSQL Data Models: NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases use various data models that differ from the traditional relational model. Examples include document databases (e.g., MongoDB), key-value stores (e.g., Redis), columnar databases (e.g., Apache Cassandra), and graph databases (e.g., Neo4j). Each NoSQL model offers specific features and trade-offs to suit different data management needs.
> 
> These are some of the commonly used data model types. It's important to choose a data model that aligns with the requirements and characteristics of the data, as well as the specific use cases and technologies being employed.

> ***Analytical Operations***
> 
> Analytical operations in big data pipelines refer to the specific tasks and processes performed on data as it flows through a pipeline for analysis and insights generation. These operations are designed to handle large volumes of data, apply various transformations, and conduct complex computations to extract meaningful information. Here are some common analytical operations in big data pipelines:
> 
> 1. Data Ingestion: The first step in a big data pipeline is to ingest the data from various sources such as databases, data warehouses, log files, IoT devices, or streaming platforms. This involves extracting the data and loading it into a storage system or a data processing framework.

>Analytical operations in big data pipelines. After this video, you will be able to list common analytical operations within big data pipelines and describe sample applications for these analytical operations. In this lesson, we will be looking at analytical operations. These are operations used in analytics, which is the process of transforming data into insights for making more informed decisions. The purpose of analytical operations is to analyze the data to discover meaningful trends and patterns, in order to gain insights into the problem being studied. The knowledge gained from these insights ultimately lead to more informed decisions driven by data. Here are some common analytical operations that we will discuss in this lecture. Classification, clustering, path analysis and connectivity analysis. Let's start with classification. In classification, the goal is to predict a categorical target from the input data. A categorical target is one with discreet values or categories, instead of continuous values. For example, this diagram shows a classification task to determine the risk associated with a loan application. The input consists of the loan amount, applicant information such as income, age, debts, and a down payment. From this input data, the task is to determine whether the loan application is low risk or high risk. There are many classification techniques or algorithms that can be used for this problem. We will discuss a specific one, namely, decision tree in the next slide. The decision tree algorithm is one technique for classification. With this technique, decisions to perform the classification task are modeled as a tree structure. For the loan risk assessment problem, a simple decision tree is shown here, where the loan application is classified as being either low risk, or high risk, based on the loan amount. The applicant's income, and the applicant's age. The decision tree algorithm is implemented in many machine learning tools. This diagram shows how to specify decision tree from input data, KNIME. A graphical user-interface-based machine learning platform. Some examples of classification are the prediction of whether cells from a tumor are benign or malignant, categorization of handwritten digits as being zero, one, two, etc, up to nine. And determining whether a credit card transaction is legitimate or fraudulent, and classification of a loan application as being low-risk, medium-risk or high-risk, as you've seen. Another common analytical operation is cluster analysis. In cluster analysis, or clustering, the goal is to organize similar items in to groups of association. This diagram shows an example of cluster analysis in which customers are clustered into groups according to their preferences of movie genre. So, customers who like Sci-Fi movies are grouped together. Those who like drama movies are grouped together, and customers who like horror movies are grouped together. With this grouping, new movies, as well as other products, such as books, can be offered to the right type of costumers in order to generate interest and increase revenue. A simple and commonly used algorithm for cluster analysis is k-means. With k-means, samples are divided into k clusters. This clustering is done in order to minimize the variance or similarity between samples within the same cluster using some similarity measures such as distance. In this example, k is equal to three, and k-means divides the original data shown on the left into three clusters, shown as blue, green, and red on the chart on the right. The k-means clustering algorithm is implemented on many machine-learning platforms. The code here shows how to read in and parse input data, and perform k-means clustering on the data. Other examples of cluster analysis are grouping a companyâs customer base into distinct segments for more effective targeted marketing, finding articles or webpages with similar topics for retrieving relevant information. Identification of areas in the city with rates of particular types of crimes for effective management of law enforcement resources, and determining different groups of weather patterns such as rainy, cold or snowy. Classification and cluster analysis are considered machine learning and analytical operations. There are also analytical operations from graph analytics, which is the field of analytics where the underlying data is structured as, or can be modeled as the set of graphs. One analytical operation using graphs as path analysis, which analyzes sequences of nodes and edges in a graph. A common application of path analysis is to find routes from one location to another location. For example, you might want to find the shortest path from your home to your work. This path may be different depending on conditions such as the day of the week, time of day, traffic congestion, weather and etc. This code shows some operations for path analysis on neo4j, which is a graph database system using a query language called Cypher. The first operation finds the shortest path between specific nodes in a graph. The second operation finds all the shortest paths in a graph. Connectivity analysis of graphs has to do with finding and tracking groups to determine interactions between entities. Entities in highly interacting groups are more connected to each other than to entities of other groups in a graph. These groups are called communities, and are interesting to analyze as they give insights into the degree and patterns of the interaction between entities, and also between communities. Some applications of connectivity analysis are to extract conversation threads. For example, by looking at tweets and retweets. To find interacting groups, for example, to determine which users are interacting with each other users, to find influencers, for example, to understand who are the main users leading to the conversation about a particular topic. Or, who do people pay attention to? This information can be used to identify the fewest number of people with the greatest influence. For example, for political campaigns, or marketing on social media. This code shows some operations for connectivity analysis on neo4j using the query language, Cypher, again. The first operation finds the degree of all the nodes in a graph, and the second creates a histogram of degrees for all nodes in a graph to determine how connected a node in a graph is, we need to look at its degree. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to the node. A degree histogram shows the distribution of node degrees in the graph and is useful in comparing graphs and identifying types of users, for example, those who follow, versus those who are followed in social networks. To summarize and add to these techniques, the decision tree algorithm for classification and k-means algorithm for cluster analysis that we covered in this lecture are techniques from machine learning. Machine learning is a field of analytics focused on the study and construction of computer systems that can learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Our course on machine learning in this specialization will cover these algorithms in more detail, along with other algorithms used for classification and cluster analysis. As well as algorithms for other machine learning tasks, such as regression, association analysis, and tools for implementing and executing machine learning algorithms. As a summary of the Graph Analytics, the Path Analytics technique for finding the shortest path and the connectivity analysis technique for analyzing communities that we discussed earlier, are techniques used in graph analytics. As explained earlier, graph analytics is the field of analytics, where the underlying data is structured or can be modeled as a set of graphs. Our graph analytics course in the specialization will cover these and other graph techniques, and we'll also cover tools and platforms for graph analytics. In summary, analytic operations are used to discover meaningful patterns in the data in order to provide insights into the problem being studied. We looked at some of the examples of analytical operations for classification, cluster analysis, path analysis and connectivity analysis in this lecture.
